# odesolve
Using Numerical Methods (Euler and Runge Kutta) to find approximations for Ordinary Differential Equations and plot the generated solutions.

Inside the repository there is odesolve.py which contains the main functions which run the euler and rk4 method. 
eulercheck.py contains initial conditions and code for the first step of the euler method.
t.py contains initial conditions and coe for first step of the rk4 method.
solvetocheck.py contains code which allows the solveto function to run.
arrays.py checks to see if the code is compatible with numpy arrays.
test.py contains an example of an ODE plot with a euler approximation and actual solution comparison
